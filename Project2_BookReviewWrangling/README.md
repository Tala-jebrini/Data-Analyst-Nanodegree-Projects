The data was collected from two Kaggle sources using:
- Manual download (Book-Crossing dataset)
- Kaggle API (goodbooks-10k dataset)

ðŸ“Ž *Kaggle dataset links are included inside the notebook.*

## ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Data cleaning: handling nulls, fixing inconsistencies, restructuring

## ðŸ“ˆ Outcome
The cleaned and structured data was used to analyze trends in book popularity and user ratings, forming the basis for a deeper comparative analysis.
